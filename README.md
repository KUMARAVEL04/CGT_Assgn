Assignment:
1. Write a program that takes a random (graphic) sequence as input and draws the
corresponding graph using Havel-Hakimi algorithm.
2. The program also tests whether the graph is Euler graph or not. If yes, implement
Fleury’s algorithm to find an Euler path/circuit for this graph.
3. Assign random weights to the edges of this graph. Take a random vertex as input and find
the single source all destination shortest path from this vertex for this graph
implementing Dijkstra’s algorithm.
4. Find the minimum spanning tree of this weighted graph implementing Prim’s
algorithm. Find the fundamental cutsets and fundamental circuits of the graph with
respect to this minimum spanning tree.
5. Find the edge connectivity and vertex connectivity of this graph. Find the value of K for
which the graph is K-connected.

Minimum Spanning tree needs to be generated before finding Fundamental cut sets and cut vertices, initial launch might require minimum spanning tree to be generated twice to enable the buttons
